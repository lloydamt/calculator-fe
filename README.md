# calculator-fe

This repository contains a simple calculator application built using Vue.js. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Assumptions

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: The app is designed to handle basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **Input Validation**: User input is assumed to be valid numbers. The application does not handle invalid inputs like letters or special characters.
3. **Division by Zero**: Division by zero is handled gracefully by displaying an error message.
4. **Browser Compatibility**: The app is assumed to run on modern browsers that support ES6 and Vue.js.

## Limitations

1. **Complex Calculations**: The app does not support advanced mathematical operations like exponents, logarithms, or trigonometric functions.
2. **UI Responsiveness**: The app is built with basic styling and may not be fully responsive on all screen sizes.
